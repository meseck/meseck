### Hey everyone! ðŸ‘‹ðŸ˜„

My name is Erik and I am a self-taught **Frontend Developer**.   
With focus on: TypeScript / JavaScript, React, HTML & CSS and UI & UX, all while keeping accessibility in mind.

Before that I was a **Graphic Designer** and still am at my heart.   
That's why I sometimes create logos to support open source projects. See: [yabai](https://github.com/koekeishiya/yabai) or [AceJump](https://github.com/acejump/AceJump).
